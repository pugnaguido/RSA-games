My RSA
	My RSA was coding a game. For me my goal was to make a game better or more complex than 
 pong and I believe I have succeeded in that 
 and have made huge strides in my understanding of games and game levels. 
 For example one of the things that we did was designing a game and using the code . 
 I was able to make things like spiriteds and make them move and other such things which alone to me is better than pong.
 I have also depend my story telling by creating a rudimentary text based game.
 I have spent multiple hours making and practicing game creation. 
  I have learned how to code in java and how ot get sprites and model some sprites for 2d games.
